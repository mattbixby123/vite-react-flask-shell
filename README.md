# Flask Backend with React Frontend (Vite)
This repository demonstrates how to set up a project that combines a Flask backend with a React frontend using Vite. The Flask backend is a Python-based API that returns a list of users, which the React frontend fetches and displays.

## Technologies Used
- Flask: A lightweight Python microframework that is perfect for building web applications. Flask's minimalist approach makes it highly customizable and suitable for both development and production environments.
- React: A JavaScript library developed by Facebook, known for its efficiency and flexibility in building dynamic user interfaces. Reactâ€™s declarative nature simplifies the creation of complex UIs.
## Features
- Backend API built with Flask that returns user data.
- Frontend built with React that fetches and displays the user data.
- Vite is used for a fast and modern development experience.
